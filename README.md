This is my first Python project "Brain games". With this package user can try 5 different games. All games share the same mechanism. When executed, a game asks name of the player and greets them. A player can beat the game by answering correctly to 3 questions in a row. If a player makes a mistake, the game finishes. 

This file includes a short description of each game, package installation guide and an asccinema of every game with an example of both win and lose scenario.


Package installation: write in bash a command pip install brain-games --user


"Even or odd" game: you are offered one randomly generated number and you need to answer if the number is even or not.
To start the game write a bash command: brain-even.
