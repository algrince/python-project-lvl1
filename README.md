This is my first Python project "Brain games". With this package user can try 5 different games:
- Even or Odd
- Calculator
- Greatest Common Divisor
- Progression
- Prime number check

All games share the same mechanism. When executed, a game asks name of the player and greets them. A player can beat the game by answering correctly to 3 questions in a row. If a player makes a mistake, the game finishes. 

This file includes a short description of each game, package installation guide and an asciinema of every game with an example of both win and lose scenario.


## Package installation: 
Write in bash a command `pip install brain-games --user`


## "Even or odd" game: 
You are offered one randomly generated number and you need to answer if the number is even or not.
To start the game write `brain-even` bash command.
